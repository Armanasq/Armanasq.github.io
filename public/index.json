PINNs are a class of data-efficient universal function approximators that encode underlying physical laws as prior information. We will cover two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. We will provide examples and Python code snippets using TensorFlow to illustrate the concepts.\nIntroduction to PINN Formulation of PINN Data-Driven Loss Term Physics-Based Loss Term Total Loss Function Training PINN Advantages of PINN Limitations and Challenges Conclusion PINN is a powerful and innovative framework that combines the strengths of both physics-based modeling and deep learning. This approach aims to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and other physical problems by leveraging the expressiveness of neural networks while incorporating prior knowledge of the underlying physics. PINN has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to handle complex, multi-physics problems and provide accurate predictions even with limited data.\nIntroduction to PINN Traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as finite difference or finite element methods, rely on discretizing the domain and solving a system of equations. These approaches often require fine-grained meshes, which can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement for complex geometries. Additionally, these methods may struggle with noisy or incomplete data.\nPINN offers an alternative solution by combining physics-based models with neural networks, which are known for their ability to learn complex patterns and generalize well to unseen data. By parameterizing the solution using a neural network, PINN can approximate the unknown solution to a PDE using a set of training data and enforce the governing equations at the same time.\nFormulation of PINN The key idea behind PINN is to train a neural network to approximate the solution to a PDE while respecting the underlying physics. This is achieved by minimizing a loss function that consists of two components: a data-driven loss term and a physics-based loss term.\nData-Driven Loss Term The data-driven loss term ensures that the neural network accurately predicts the known data points. Suppose we have a set of N data points, denoted as {(x_i, t_i, y_i)} for i = 1, 2, …, N, where (x_i, t_i) represents the spatial and temporal coordinates, and y_i represents the corresponding observed value. The data-driven loss term is typically defined as the mean squared error between the predicted solution and the observed data:\nHere, u(x_i, t_i) denotes the predicted solution at (x_i, t_i), and Ω represents the training domain.\nPhysics-Based Loss Term The physics-based loss term ensures that the neural network satisfies the governing equations of the PDE. Suppose we have a set of K governing equations, denoted as {F_k}, where k = 1, 2, …, K. These equations represent the physical laws or conservation principles governing the system. The physics-based loss term is typically defined as the mean squared error between the residuals of the governing equations:\nHere, R_k(u) denotes the residual of the kth governing equation, which is obtained by substituting the predicted solution u(x, t) into the kth equation.\nTotal Loss Function The total loss function is the sum of the data-driven loss term and the physics-based loss term:\nHere, α and β are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of the data-driven and physics-based terms, respectively.\nTraining PINN To train a PINN, we typically use an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), to minimize the total loss function. The weights and biases of the neural network are updated iteratively to find the optimal solution. During the training process, the network learns to approximate the unknown solution to the PDE by minimizing the data-driven loss term while satisfying the physics-based loss term.\nAdvantages of PINN PINN offers several advantages over traditional methods for solving PDEs:\nFlexibility: PINN can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions without the need for explicit meshing or grid generation. This flexibility allows for easier integration with real-world applications and reduces the computational cost associated with mesh generation.\nGeneralizability: Neural networks have the ability to generalize well to unseen data. Once trained, a PINN can accurately predict the solution at any point within the domain, even in regions where no data points are available. This is particularly useful when dealing with sparse or noisy data.\nMulti-physics Applications: PINN is capable of solving multi-physics problems by incorporating multiple sets of governing equations.

The proposed model in this repository aims to accurately classify skin lesion images into three classes: benign, malignant, and unknown. To achieve this, the model utilizes a combination of pre-trained deep learning models, including ResNet-50, EfficientNet-V2, Inception-V3, and GoogLeNet, each with their specific strengths and features. By leveraging the power of ensemble learning, the model can make robust and accurate predictions.\nThis code is part of the Carcinoma Classification competition, specifically focusing on classifying HES stained histopathological slices as containing or not containing carcinoma cells. The goal is to determine if a carcinoma is present and, if so, whether it is benign or malignant. The competition provides a dataset of 186 images, with labels available for only 62 of them. Due to the limited training data, participants are encouraged to leverage pre-trained models and apply various techniques to improve classification performance.\nDataset The dataset consists of HES stained histopathological slices. Each image may contain carcinoma cells, and the corresponding labels indicate whether the carcinoma is benign (0), malignant (1), or not present (-1). It is important to note that the training data is highly imbalanced, and a naive classification approach labeling all samples as healthy would yield high accuracy but an unbalanced precision/recall trade-off. The evaluation metric for this competition is the Mean F1-Score, which provides a good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\nApproach To tackle this task, several approaches can be employed:\nRelying on a pre-trained model and using zero/few-shot learning techniques. Fine-tuning the last layer of a pre-trained model for a new classification task. Leveraging a pre-trained model and applying a different classifier, such as Gaussian Process, SVMs, or XGBoost. Preprocessing Several preprocessing considerations should be taken into account when working with this dataset:\nImage Size: The images in the dataset do not have the same size, and cropping them may result in missing the target cells. Resizing the images may alter their features and make them less readable, so careful handling is necessary. Methodology The code provided implements a deep learning pipeline for image classification using pre-trained models. The pipeline consists of the following steps:\nSetting seeds: The set_seeds function sets the random seeds to ensure reproducibility of the results.\nCustomDataset class: This class is used to create a custom dataset for loading and preprocessing the image data. It takes the image directory, labels file, and optional transformations as inputs. The class provides methods to retrieve the length of the dataset and individual data items.\nDevice setup: The code checks if a GPU is available and sets the device accordingly.\nData preparation:\nLoading labeled dataset: The labeled dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing image labels. Finding maximum size: The maximum width and height of the images in the dataset are determined. Data transformation: Two main data transformation pipelines are defined: main_transform: Resizes the images to the maximum width and height, converts them to tensors, and applies normalization. augmentation_transform: Includes resizing, random flips, rotation, color jitter, and normalization for data augmentation. Dataset creation: The main dataset and augmented dataset are created using the CustomDataset class and the respective transformation pipelines. Combining datasets: The main dataset and augmented dataset are combined using the ConcatDataset class.

It contains a diverse set of challenges for researchers, including object detection, tracking, and scene understanding. The dataset is derived from the autonomous driving platform developed by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.\nThe KITTI dataset includes a collection of different sensors and modalities, such as stereo cameras, LiDAR, and GPS/INS sensors, which provides a comprehensive view of the environment around the vehicle. The data was collected over several days in the urban areas of Karlsruhe and nearby towns in Germany. The dataset includes more than 200,000 stereo images and their corresponding point clouds, as well as data from the GPS/INS sensors, which provide accurate location and pose information.\nThe dataset is divided into several different categories, each with its own set of challenges. These categories include object detection, tracking, scene understanding, visual odometry, and road/lane detection. Each category contains a set of challenges that researchers can use to evaluate their algorithms and compare their results with others in the field.\nOne of the strengths of the KITTI dataset is its accuracy and precision. The sensors used to collect the data provide a high level of detail and accuracy, making it possible to detect and track objects with high precision. Additionally, the dataset includes a large number of real-world scenarios, which makes it more representative of real-world driving conditions.\nAnother strength of the KITTI dataset is its large size. The dataset includes over 50 GB of data, which includes stereo images, point clouds, and GPS/INS data. This large amount of data makes it possible to train deep neural networks, which are known to perform well on large datasets.\nDespite its strengths, the KITTI dataset also has some limitations. For example, the dataset only covers urban driving scenarios, which may not be representative of driving conditions in other environments. Additionally, the dataset is relatively small compared to other computer vision datasets, which may limit its applicability in certain domains.\nIn summary, the KITTI dataset is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of autonomous driving. Its accuracy, precision, and large size make it an ideal dataset for evaluating and comparing algorithms for object detection, tracking, and scene understanding. While it has some limitations, its strengths make it a popular and widely used dataset in the field.\nData Format The KITTI dataset is available in two formats: raw data and preprocessed data. The raw data contains a large amount of sensor data, including images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS/IMU measurements, and can be used for various research purposes. The preprocessed data provides more structured data, including object labels, and can be used directly for tasks such as object detection and tracking.\nDownloading the Dataset The KITTI dataset can be downloaded from the official website (http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) after registering with a valid email address.

Why ROS? Step 1: Installing ROS Step 2: Creating a ROS Workspace Step 3: Creating a ROS Package Step 4: Writing a ROS Program Conclusion Tutorial: Getting Started with ROS (Robot Operating System) Introduction Welcome to our step-by-step tutorial on getting started with ROS (Robot Operating System). ROS is an open-source framework for building robotic systems. It provides a collection of libraries, tools, and conventions to help developers create robust and modular robot applications. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up ROS, creating a ROS workspace, and running your first ROS program. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid foundation for working with ROS and developing your own robotic applications.\nWhat is ROS? ROS, short for Robot Operating System, is an open-source framework designed for building robotic systems. It provides a flexible and modular architecture that enables developers to create complex robot applications by leveraging a wide range of libraries, tools, and community-contributed packages.\nROS was initially developed at Stanford University in 2007 and has since gained significant popularity in the robotics community. It has a large and active user base, which has contributed to the extensive development and refinement of its features and capabilities.\nDespite its name, ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense. Rather, it serves as a middleware layer that runs on top of a conventional operating system (such as Linux) and provides a set of abstractions and functionalities specifically tailored for robotics.\nOne of the key strengths of ROS is its focus on collaboration and reusability. It encourages the development and sharing of reusable software components called “packages.” These packages encapsulate specific functionalities or algorithms, making it easier for developers to build upon existing work and leverage the collective knowledge and expertise of the ROS community.\nROS follows a distributed architecture, where different processes, called “nodes,” communicate with each other by passing messages. This messaging system allows nodes to exchange data, commands, and sensor information in a standardized and interoperable manner. It promotes modularity and scalability, enabling developers to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable components that can be developed and tested independently.\nFurthermore, ROS provides a wide range of tools for visualization, simulation, debugging, and analysis, which greatly simplify the development and debugging process. These tools include visualization tools like RViz for visualizing robot models and sensor data, simulation environments like Gazebo for testing and evaluating robot behavior, and debugging tools like rqt_console for monitoring and analyzing the system’s log messages.\nOverall, ROS has become the de facto standard in the field of robotics due to its versatility, modularity, and active community. It has been widely adopted in both academic and industrial settings for a variety of applications, ranging from autonomous vehicles and industrial robots to medical robotics and research platforms.\nIn the next sections of this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up ROS, creating a workspace, and running your first ROS program. This will provide you with a solid foundation to start developing your own robotic applications using the powerful capabilities of ROS.\nWhy ROS? ROS, or Robot Operating System, has gained significant popularity in the robotics community for several compelling reasons. Let’s explore why ROS has become the framework of choice for many roboticists and researchers:\nModularity and Reusability: ROS encourages a modular approach to software development, where functionalities are encapsulated into reusable components called packages. This modularity makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain individual components, and enables seamless integration of different software modules into a larger robotic system. The extensive package ecosystem of ROS allows developers to leverage existing solutions and build upon the work of others, saving time and effort.\nInteroperability: ROS promotes interoperability by providing a standardized messaging system for communication between different nodes. Nodes can exchange data, commands, and sensor information using ROS messages, services, and topics. This standardized communication protocol allows for the seamless integration of various hardware and software components, making it easier to build complex robotic systems with heterogeneous components.\nCommunity and Collaboration: ROS has a large and active community of developers and researchers.

In this tutorial, we will explore advanced techniques for improving your performance in Kaggle competitions. Specifically, we will focus on model stacking and ensemble techniques, which involve combining the predictions of multiple models to create a more robust and accurate final prediction. Model stacking and ensembling are widely used strategies in data science competitions to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building stacked models and ensembles, including the necessary code and techniques to implement them effectively. Let’s get started!\nStep 1: Building Base Models The first step in model stacking and ensembling is to build a set of diverse base models. These base models can be different machine learning algorithms or variations of the same algorithm with different hyperparameters. Follow these steps to build your base models:\nSelect Algorithms: Choose a variety of machine learning algorithms that complement each other. For example, you can include algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. Train Base Models: Train each base model on your training dataset using cross-validation or any other appropriate technique. Optimize the hyperparameters for each model to achieve the best performance. Generate Predictions: Use the trained base models to generate predictions for the validation dataset. These predictions will be used as input for the next step of model stacking. Step 2: Building the Stacked Model The next step is to build the stacked model using the predictions generated by the base models. Follow these steps to create your stacked model:\nPrepare Stacking Data: Create a new dataset using the predictions from the base models as features. Each prediction from the base models will be a new feature in the stacking dataset. Split Stacking Data: Split the stacking dataset into a training set and a holdout set. The training set will be used to train the stacked model, while the holdout set will be used for evaluation. Train Stacked Model: Train a meta-model (e.g., a simple linear regression or a neural network) on the training set of the stacking dataset. This meta-model will learn to combine the predictions from the base models to make the final prediction. Evaluate Stacked Model: Use the holdout set of the stacking dataset to evaluate the performance of the stacked model. Calculate appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization. Step 3: Building Ensemble Models In addition to stacked models, ensembling is another powerful technique to improve model performance. Follow these steps to build ensemble models:\nSelect Ensemble Algorithms: Choose ensemble algorithms such as Bagging, Boosting, or Voting. These algorithms combine the predictions of multiple models using different aggregation techniques. Train Ensemble Models: Train each ensemble model using the training dataset. Each ensemble model will incorporate the predictions from different base models or stacked models. Generate Ensemble Predictions: Use the trained ensemble models to generate predictions for the validation dataset or test dataset. Combine the predictions using the appropriate ensemble aggregation technique (e.g., averaging, weighted averaging, or majority voting). Evaluate Ensemble Models: Evaluate the performance of the ensemble models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Compare the results with the individual base models or stacked models to assess the improvement achieved through ensembling. Step 4: Fine-tuning and Validation After building the stacked models and ensemble models, it’s essential to fine-tune them and validate their performance. Follow these steps to fine-tune and validate your models:\nHyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the base models, stacked models , and ensemble models. Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters that maximize performance. 2.

The suite consists of 158 tests and covers a distance of over 42 km, with OMC ground track available for 132 tests. Therefore, it does not include pure rotational movements and pure translational movements, which are helpful for systematically evaluating the model’s performance under different conditions; however, it covers a wide range of everyday movements.\nDue to the different focus, some information (for example, the alignment of the coordinate frames) is not accurately described. In addition, the orientation of the ground trace contains frequent irregularities (e.g., jumps in orientation that are not accompanied by similar jumps in the IMU data). The dataset is available at Link.\nHow to use OxIOD Dataset The dataset can be download from here.

RoNIN dataset [1] contains over 40 hours of IMU sensor data from 100 human subjects with 3D ground-truth trajectories under natural human movements. This data set provides measurements of the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and ground track, including direction and location in 327 sequences and at a frequency of 200 Hz. A two-device data collection protocol was developed. A harness was used to attach one phone to the body for 3D tracking, allowing subjects to control the other phone to collect IMU data freely. It should be noted that the ground track can only be obtained using the 3D tracker phone attached to the harness. In addition, the body trajectory is estimated instead of the IMU. RoNIN datset contians 42.7 hours of IMU-motion data over 276 sequences in 3 buildings, and collected from 100 human subjects with three Android devices.

Various instruments and sensors have been developed over the last few decades to achieve this goal. However, the cost and complexity of these instruments can be prohibitive. To address this issue, Multi-Data Sensor Fusion (MSDF) techniques have been developed, which allow for the use of multiple sensors to sense a quantity from different perspectives or sense multiple quantities to reduce errors and uncertainties. This article explores the use of MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in attitude determination and discusses the challenges associated with noise and bias. Finally, the article describes different forms of attitude representation, including Tait-Bryan angles, rotation matrices, and quaternions.\nIntroduction Achieving accurate and precise attitude determination or estimation is essential for successful navigation of air and space vehicles. To achieve this goal, each vehicle must determine and control its attitude based on mission requirements. A wide variety of instruments, sensors, and algorithms have been developed over the last few decades, distinguished by their cost and complexity. However, using an accurate sensor can exponentially increase the cost, which may exceed the budget.\nA low-cost solution for achieving high accuracy is to use multiple sensors (homogeneous or heterogeneous) to sense a quantity from different perspectives or sense multiple quantities to reduce errors and uncertainties. Multiple sensors fuse their data to achieve a more accurate quantity, a technique called Multi-Data Sensor Fusion (MSDF). MSDF uses mathematical methods to reduce noise and uncertainty and to estimate the quantity based on prior data. MSDF can also be used for attitude determination.\nAttitude determination methods can be broadly divided into two classes: single-point and recursive estimation. The first method calculates the attitude by using two or more vector measurements at a single point in time. In contrast, recursive methods use the combination of measurements over time and the system’s mathematical model. Obtaining precise attitude determination is challenging due to errors in system modeling, processes, and measurements. Increasing the sensor’s precision may exponentially increase the cost, and sometimes, achieving the required precision may only be possible at an exorbitant cost.\nOne approach for determining attitude is to use inertial navigation algorithms based on inertial sensors. Inertial navigation is based on the Dead Reckoning method, which uses different types of inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, known as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The position, velocity, and attitude of a moving object can be determined using numerical integration of IMU measurements.\nThe use of low-cost Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based IMUs has grown in the past decade. Due to recent advances in MEMS technology, IMUs have become smaller, cheaper, and more accurate, making them available for use in mobile robots, smartphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. However, these sensors suffer from noise and bias, which directly affect the performance of attitude estimation algorithms.\nTo tackle this problem and increase the accuracy and reliability of attitude estimation techniques, different MSDF techniques and Deep Learning models have been developed in the past few decades.\nAttitude can be represented in many different forms. The Tait-Bryan angles (also called Euler angles) are the most familiar form and are known as yaw, pitch, and roll (or heading, elevation, and bank). Engineers widely use rotation matrices and quaternions, but quaternions are less intuitive.\nRelated Work In the past decade, extensive research has been conducted on inertial navigation techniques. These studies can be roughly divided into three categories: estimation methods, Multi-Data Sensor Fusion (MSDF) techniques, and evolutionary/AI algorithms. The Kalman Filter family (i.e., EKF, UKF, MEKF), as well as other commonly used algorithms such as Madgwick and Mahony, are based on the dynamic model of the system. The Kalman filter was first introduced in [], and its variants such as EKF, UKF, and MEKF have been implemented for attitude estimation applications.\nIn [], Carsuo et al. compared different sensor fusion algorithms for inertial attitude estimation. This comparative study showed that the performance of Sensor Fusion Algorithms (SFA) is highly dependent on parameter tuning, and fixed parameter values are not suitable for all applications. Therefore, parameter tuning is one …","date":1666656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666656000,"objectID":"f11b2beebaf1c8d86ec484bd1263706f","permalink":"https://armanasq.github.io/Attitude-Estimation-CNN/","publishdate":"2022-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Attitude-Estimation-CNN/","section":"post","summary":"Abstract Introduction Problem definition Background Attitude Attitude Determination from Inertial Sensors Methodology Deep Learning Model Loss Function Experiment Dataset RepoIMU T-stick RepoIMU T-pendulum Sassari OxIOD MAV Dataset EuRoC MAV TUM-VI KITTI RIDI RoNIN BROAD Training Evaluation Abstract This article discusses the importance of accurate and precise attitude determination in navigation for air and space vehicles.","tags":["Navigation","Attitude Estimation","Orientaion Estimation"],"title":"CNN Based Attitude Estimation","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"⇐ Kaggle\nTutorial 4: Advanced Model Building Techniques Introduction Step 1: Ensemble Learning Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning Step 3: Feature Selection Step 4: Model Stacking Conclusion Tutorial 4: Advanced Model Building Techniques Introduction Welcome to Tutorial 4 of our Kaggle series! In this tutorial, we will explore advanced model building techniques that can help you improve your performance in Kaggle competitions. We will cover various topics, including ensemble learning, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model stacking. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a deeper understanding of these advanced techniques and how to apply them effectively. Let’s dive in!\nStep 1: Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to improve predictive performance. Here are a few popular ensemble techniques:\nVoting: Combine predictions from multiple models by majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression). Bagging: Train multiple models on different subsets of the training data and average their predictions. Boosting: Train models sequentially, where each subsequent model focuses on the examples the previous models struggled with. Stacking: Combine predictions from multiple models as input to a meta-model, which makes the final prediction. Ensemble learning can help improve the robustness and generalization of your models by leveraging the strengths of different algorithms.\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier from sklearn.ensemble import StackingRegressor from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier # Create an ensemble of classifiers clf1 = DecisionTreeClassifier() clf2 = LogisticRegression() voting_clf = VotingClassifier(estimators=[(\u0026#39;dt\u0026#39;, clf1), (\u0026#39;lr\u0026#39;, clf2)], voting=\u0026#39;hard\u0026#39;) # Create an ensemble of bagged regressors bagging_regressor = BaggingRegressor(base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor()) # Create an ensemble of boosted classifiers boosted_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier()) # Create a stacked ensemble regressor stacked_regressor = StackingRegressor(estimators=[(\u0026#39;dt\u0026#39;, clf1), (\u0026#39;lr\u0026#39;, clf2)], final_estimator=RandomForestRegressor()) Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning Hyperparameters are the settings that define how a model is trained. Tuning these hyperparameters can significantly impact model performance. Here’s how you can perform hyperparameter tuning:\nGrid Search: Define a grid of hyperparameter values and exhaustively search through all possible combinations. Random Search: Define a distribution for each hyperparameter and randomly sample combinations. Bayesian Optimization: Use Bayesian methods to efficiently search the hyperparameter space. Hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive, but it’s essential for finding the best configurations for your models.\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier # Grid Search param_grid = {\u0026#39;n_estimators\u0026#39;: [100, 200, 300], \u0026#39;max_depth\u0026#39;: [None, 5, 10]} grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5) grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train) # Random Search param_dist = {\u0026#39;n_estimators\u0026#39;: [100, 200, 300], \u0026#39;max_depth\u0026#39;: [None, 5, 10]} random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_distributions=param_dist, cv=5) random_search.fit(X_train, y_train) Step 3: Feature Selection Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features for model training. It helps reduce dimensionality, improve model interpretability, and avoid overfitting. Consider the following techniques:\nFilter Methods: Use statistical tests or correlation analysis to rank features based on their relevance. 2. Wrapper Methods: Train models with different subsets of features and select the best subset based on model performance. 3. Embedded Methods: Select features as part of the model training process (e.g., L1 regularization).\nFeature selection can be performed before or during model training, depending on the approach used.\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # Filter Methods - SelectKBest selector = SelectKBest(k=10) X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train) # Wrapper Methods - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) estimator = LogisticRegression() rfe = RFECV(estimator=estimator, step=1, cv=5) X_train_selected = rfe.fit_transform(X_train, y_train) # Embedded Methods - L1 Regularization estimator = LogisticRegression(penalty=\u0026#39;l1\u0026#39;, solver=\u0026#39;liblinear\u0026#39;) estimator.fit(X_train, y_train) Step 4: Model Stacking Model stacking is a powerful technique where predictions from multiple models are used as input to a meta-model, which then makes the final prediction. …","date":1666224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666224000,"objectID":"c480aedcaca833f2b74a12ae3426fa76","permalink":"https://armanasq.github.io/kaggle/tutorial-04/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/kaggle/tutorial-04/","section":"post","summary":"⇐ Kaggle\nTutorial 4: Advanced Model Building Techniques Introduction Step 1: Ensemble Learning Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning Step 3: Feature Selection Step 4: Model Stacking Conclusion Tutorial 4: Advanced Model Building Techniques Introduction Welcome to Tutorial 4 of our Kaggle series!","tags":["Kaggle","Tutorial"],"title":"Kagle Tutorial 4","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"⇐ Kaggle\nTutorial 3: Participating in Kaggle Competitions Introduction Step 1: Finding Competitions Step 2: Joining a Competition Step 3: Understanding the Problem Statement Step 4: Exploring the Data Step 5: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Step 6: Building and Training Models Step 7: Making Submissions Step 8: Learning from the Community Conclusion Tutorial 3: Participating in Kaggle Competitions Introduction Welcome to Tutorial 3 of our Kaggle series!

In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of exploring datasets on Kaggle. Datasets form the foundation of data science projects, providing valuable insights and opportunities for analysis. Kaggle offers a vast collection of datasets across various domains, making it an ideal platform for data exploration and practice. We will cover the key aspects of dataset exploration, including finding datasets, understanding their characteristics, and performing basic data analysis. Let’s get started!\nStep 1: Finding Datasets on Kaggle Kaggle hosts a wide range of datasets, covering diverse topics such as finance, healthcare, sports, and more. Here’s how you can find datasets on Kaggle:\nVisit the Kaggle website at https://www.kaggle.com and log in to your account. Click on the “Datasets” tab in the top navigation bar. Explore the featured datasets on the main page or use the search bar to find specific datasets of interest. Refine your search using filters such as popularity, recency, or topic tags to narrow down the results. By browsing through the datasets, you can find interesting projects, public datasets, and valuable resources to enhance your data science skills.\nStep 2: Understanding Dataset Details Before diving into data analysis, it’s essential to understand the key details of a dataset. Here’s what you should look for:\nDescription: Read the dataset description to gain insights into its purpose, contents, and potential applications. This information helps you understand the context and scope of the dataset. Size: Check the size of the dataset, which indicates the number of records, variables, and storage requirements. Large datasets may require additional computational resources for analysis. Attributes: Identify the attributes (columns) present in the dataset. Understanding the variables and their data types helps in planning the analysis and preprocessing steps. Associated Competitions or Kernels: Check if the dataset is associated with any competitions or kernels. This provides additional context and potential approaches for analysis. Step 3: Previewing and Accessing the Dataset To explore the dataset further, you can preview its contents and access the data files. Follow these steps:\nClick on a dataset of interest to view its details page. Scroll down to the “Data” section, where you can find the dataset files available for download. Click on a file name to preview its contents. Some datasets may offer a preview of a subset of the data, giving you a glimpse of the structure and values. Once you have an understanding of the dataset and its files, you can proceed to access the data and perform analysis using your preferred tools and programming languages.\nStep 4: Loading and Analyzing the Dataset To analyze the dataset, you need to load it into your data analysis environment. Let’s consider an example where we load a CSV file using Python and perform basic analysis:\nimport pandas as pd # Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;dataset.csv\u0026#39;) # Explore the dataset # - Display the first few rows print(data.head()) # - Check the dimensions (rows, columns) print(\u0026#39;Dimensions:\u0026#39;, data.shape) # - Summary statistics print(\u0026#39;Summary Statistics:\u0026#39;, data.describe()) # - Data types of variables print(\u0026#39;Data Types:\u0026#39;, data.dtypes) # - Missing values print(\u0026#39;Missing Values:\u0026#39;, data.isnull().sum()) By loading the dataset into a DataFrame and performing basic analysis, you gain insights into the data structure, summary statistics, data types, and missing values.\nStep 5: Visualizing the Dataset Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding the patterns and relationships within a dataset. Let’s visualize a dataset using Python’s Matplotlib library:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Visualize the dataset # - Histogram of a numerical variable plt.hist(data[\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;]) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Age\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Frequency\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Distribution of Age\u0026#39;) plt.show() # - Bar chart of a categorical variable plt.bar(data[\u0026#39;gender\u0026#39;].value_counts().index, data[\u0026#39;gender\u0026#39;].value_counts().values) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;Gender\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;Count\u0026#39;) plt.title(\u0026#39;Distribution of Gender\u0026#39;) plt.show() Visualizing the dataset provides valuable insights into the distribution, relationships, and trends present in the data.\nStep 6: Refining the Analysis After the initial exploration, you may discover areas of interest or specific questions to investigate further.

Each flying vehicle either in air or space, needs to determine and control its attitude based on mission requirements. Vast variety of instruments/sensors and algorithm have been developed in the last decades; they are distinct by their cost and complexity. Use an accurate sensor will exponentially increase the cost which could exceed the budget. A solution for increase the accuracy with low cost is to use multi sensors (homogenous or heterogenous); multiple sensors could sense a quantity from different perspective or sense multi quantities to reduce the error and uncertainty. Multiple sensors fuse their data to achieve more accurate quantity, this method usually called as Multi-Data Sensor Fusion (MSDF). MSDF use mathematical methods to reduce noise, uncertainty and also estimate the quantity based on priori data and it could be utlized for attitude determiation. Attitude determination methods could be broadly divided in two classes, single-point and recursive estimation. First method calculates the attitude by use of two or more vector measurements at a single point of time. Instead, recursive methods use the combination of measurements over time and the system mathematical model. A precise attitude determination is dependent on sensor’s precision, accurate system modeling, and the information processing method. Obtaining this precision is considered a challenging navigation problem due to system modeling, process, and measurements errors. Increase the sensor’s precision may exponentially increase the cost; sometimes, achieving the precision requirements will only be possible for an exorbitant cost.\nOne approach for determining the attitude is using inertial navigation algorithms based inertial sensors. Inertial Navigation is based on the Dead Reckoning method. In this method, different types of inertial sensors are used such as accelerometer and gyroscope which called Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A moving object’s position, velocity, and attitude can be determined using numerical integration of IMU measurements.\nUsing low-cost Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has been grown in the past decade. Due to recent advances in MEMS technology, IMUs became smaller, cheaper, and more accurate, and they are now available for use in mobile robots, smartphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. This sensors suffers from noise and bias, which affect dirctly the performance attitude estimation alogrithm. In the past decades, different MSDF techniques and Deep Learning models have been developed to tackle this problem and increase the accuracy and reliability of attitude estimation techniques.\nAttitude can be represented in many different forms. The Tait-Bryan angles (also called Euler angles) are the most familiar form and known as yaw, pitch, and roll (or heading, elevation, and bank). Engineers widely use rotation matrix and quaternions, but the quaternions are less intuitive.\nRelated works In the past decade, much research has been conducted on the inertial navigation techniques. These studies could roughly divided in three categories, estimation methods, Multi-Data Sensor Fusion (MSDF) techinques, and evolutionary/AI algorithms. Kalman Filter family (i.e., EKF, UKF, MEKF) and other commonly used algorithms such as Madgwick, and Mahony are based on the dynamic model of the system. Kalman filter first introduced in [], and its vairents such as EKF, UKF, and MEKF have been implemented for attitude estimation applications.\nIn [] Carsuo et al. compared different sensor fusion algorithms for inertial attitude estimation. this comparative study showed that Sensor Fusion Algorithms (SFA) performance are highly depended to parameters tuning and fixed parameter values are not suitable for all applications. So, the parameter tuning is one the disadvantages of conventioal attitude estimation method. This problem could be tackeld by using evolutionary algorithms such as fuzzy logic and deep learning. Most of deep learning approches in inertial nvigation has focues on inertial odomotery and just few of them try to solve the inertial attitude estimation problem. Deep learning methods usually used for visual or visual-inertial based navigation. Chen et\nRochefort et al., proposed a neural networks-based satellite attitude estimation algorithm by using a quaternion neural network. This study presents a new way of integrating the neural network into the state estimator and develops a training procedure which is easy to implement. This algorithm provides the same accuracy as the EKF with significantly lower computational complexity.

In this post, we will present some of the most popular IMU Datasets. The datasets are divided into two categories: synthetic and real-world. The synthetic datasets are generated by simulating the IMU measurements. The real-world datasets are collected from the real-world experiments. The real-world experiments are divided into two categories: indoor and outdoor. The indoor experiments are conducted in a controlled environment, e.g., a laboratory. The outdoor experiments are conducted in an uncontrolled environment, e.g., a car. Also, to train, validate and test any neural network model, we need a database including accurate input and output. A Deep Learning model’s performance will be directly affected by the data that is used for it. So, to train the Deep Learning model we need a database containing the input and output parameters with following conditions:\nThe input and output parameters should be accurate. The amount of data must be sufficient to train the Deep Learning model The data should be diverse enough to cover all the possible scenarios. In the following sections, we will present some of the most popular IMU Datasets.\nRepoIMU T-stick The RepoIMU T-stick [1] is a small, low-cost, and high-performance inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can be used for a wide range of applications. The RepoIMU T-stick is a 9-axis IMU that measures the acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field. This database contains two separate sets of experiments recorded with a T-stick and a pendulum. A total of 29 trials were collected on the T-stick, and each trial lasted approximately 90 seconds. As the name suggests, the IMU is attached to a T-shaped stick equipped with six reflective markers. Each experiment consists of slow or fast rotation around a principal sensor axis or translation along a principal sensor axis. In this scenario, the data from the Vicon Nexus OMC system and the XSens MTi IMU are synchronized and provided at a frequency of 100 Hz. The authors clearly state that the IMU coordinate system and the ground trace are not aligned and propose a method to compensate for one of the two required rotations based on quaternion averaging. Unfortunately, some experiments contain gyroscope clipping and ground tracking, which significantly affect the obtained errors. Therefore, careful pre-processing and removal of some trials should be considered when using the dataset to evaluate the model’s accuracy. The dataset is available at Link.\nRepoIMU T-pendulum The second part of the RepoIMU dataset contains data from a triple pendulum on which the IMUs are mounted. Measurement data is provided at 90 Hz or 166 Hz. However, the IMU data contains duplicate samples. This is usually the result of artificial sampling or transmission problems where missed samples are replaced by duplicating the last sample received, effectively reducing the sampling rate. The sampling rate achieved when discarding frequent samples is about 25 Hz and 48 Hz for the accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively. Due to this issue, it is not recommended to use this database for model training and evaluation. Due to this fact, we cannot recommend using pendulum tests to evaluate the accuracy of IOE with high precision.\nSassari The Sassari dataset published in [2] aims to validate a parameter tuning approach based on the orientation difference of two IMUs of the same model. To facilitate this, six IMUs from three manufacturers (Xsens, APDM, Shimmer) are placed on a wooden board. Rotation around specific axes and free rotation around all axes are repeated at three different speeds. Data is synchronized and presented at 100 Hz. Local coordinate frames are aligned by precise manual placement. There are 18 experiments (3 speeds, 3 IMU models, and 2 IMUs of each model) in this dataset.\nAccording to these points, this database seems to be a suitable option for training, evaluating, and testing the model, but some essential points should be paid attention to. The inclusion of different speeds and different types of IMUs helped to diversify the data set. However, all motions occur in a homogeneous magnetic field and do not involve pure translational motions. Therefore, this data set does not have a robust variety in terms of the type of movement and the variety of magnetic data. Therefore, the model trained with it cannot be robust and general. However, it can be used to evaluate the model.\nThe total movement duration of all three trials is 168 seconds, with the most extended movement phase lasting 30 seconds. For this reason, considering the short time, it is not a suitable option for training. The dataset is available at Link.\nOxIOD The Oxford Inertial Odometry Dataset (OxIOD) [3] is a large set of inertial data recorded by …","date":1663459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663459200,"objectID":"96717597f52c6ebacd5450530e9f8dc0","permalink":"https://armanasq.github.io/datasets/imu-datsets/","publishdate":"2022-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/datasets/imu-datsets/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction RepoIMU T-stick RepoIMU T-pendulum Sassari OxIOD MAV Dataset EuRoC MAV TUM-VI KITTI RIDI RoNIN BROAD References Introduction IMU Datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the attitude estimation algorithms.","tags":["Dataset","IMU","Inertial Measurement Unit"],"title":"IMU Datasets","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"⇐ Kaggle\nKaggle Tutorial 1: Introduction to Kaggle Introduction Step 1: Creating a Kaggle Account Step 2: Exploring Datasets on Kaggle Step 3: Getting Started with Kaggle Kernels Conclusion Kaggle Tutorial 1: Introduction to Kaggle Introduction Welcome to the first tutorial in our Kaggle series!

These strategies can be divided into two major categories, GPS-based and Odometry. Odometry or position tracking is a form of navigation to detect the position and orientation of a robot by measuring the distance and angle of the robot’s movement using sensor data (e.g., inertial, visual, and radar). Position tracking is a fundamental task in autonomous navigation and it is a key component in many other applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. There are many odometry sensors, such as wheel encoders, inertial measurement units (IMU), and LiDAR. Odometry can be divided into two categories: dead reckoning and visual odometry. The process of dead reckoning involves calculating the current position from a previously determined position and orientation, taking into account acceleration, speed, and heading direction over a given period of time. Instead, visual odometry uses optical sensor data to analyze image sequences and provide incremental online pose estimation. In recent years, much attention has been drawn to this technique because it has high accuracy and generates less drift error than conventional methods but the high computation cost is one of its main challenges. Also, inertial sensor readings could be fused with visual odometry or can be used alone to estimate a robot’s position and orientation.\nInertial Odometery techniques typically use a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes to estimate the 3D motion of a robot. The accelerometer measures the linear acceleration, while the gyroscope measures the angular velocity. IMUs despite all other types of sensors are independent of the environment and are egocentric. Moreover, recent advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology have enabled IMUs to become smaller, cheaper, and more accurate. They are now available for use in mobile robots, smartphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles. Low cost MEMS based IMUs are suffering from noise, drift and bias errors. Machnie learning approaches can be used to compensate these noises and biases.\nThe most challenging part of odometry estimation is trajectory tracking, independent of the type of motion. Estimate direction of gravity vector, noise and bias, simultanously is a challenging task. One of the simple suloition is double integration of accelerometer data. But, it is not accurate enough and could lead to high drift errors in the output. Another sulotion is to use a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is a recursive Bayesian estimator that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe.\nRecent studies have proposed a new deep learning aproch which known as Inertial Odometry Neuran Network (IONet) which could be used to estimate the 3D motion using IMUs measurements [aboldeoopio]. IONets are based on the idea of using a deep neural network to learn the relationship between the IMU raw data and the ground truth without any handcrafted engineering [chen2019]. The main advantage of this approach is that it can learn the features of the data and can be used to estimate the odometry of a robot but it requires a large amount of data to train the model. Also, it is computationally expensive. Perviouse studies shown that IONets outperforms the conventional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach to estimate the odometry of a robot. The proposed method is based on a deep neural network that uses Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers to learn the complex relationship between the IMU raw data and the ground truth. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost.\nRelated Work Inertial Navigation Systems A Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) works by double integrating accelerometer readings on a rigidly mounted vehicle to determine the postion.

The Rodrigues Parameter preferred as an attitude error representation because it is a unit vector and it is easy to calculate the attitude error between two quaternions. The attitude error between two quaternions can be calculated using the following:\n$$ \\mathbf{g}_{error} = \\frac{2\\mathbf{q}_{v}}{q_0} $$ The Gibbs vector components expereince a singularity at $ \\theta = \\pi $, which is the same as the Euler angles. The Gibbs vector is not a good representation for small rotations. Modified Rodrigues Parameters In attitude filter design Modified Rodrigues Parameters (MRP) is preferred for attitude error representation. The MRP is a set of three parameters denoted by $ \\mathbf{m} $ and can be directly derived from axis-angle $ (e, \\theta) $ or quaternion representation as follows:\n$$ \\mathbf{m} = \\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{v}}{1+q_0} $$ $$ \\mathbf{m} = \\frac{e \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}}{1+\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}} $$ where $ \\mathbf{q}_{v} $ is the vector part of the quaternion, $ e $ is the unit vector of the axis of rotation, and $ \\theta $ is the angle of rotation. Due to above equation the maximum equivalent rotation to describe is $ \\pm 360^{\\circ}$ (the singularity occurs in $ \\pm 360^{\\circ}$).\nCayley-Klein The Cayley-Klein parameters are consisting of 4 parameters which are closely related to the quaternions and denoted by matrix $ \\mathbf{K}_{2\\times 2} $.\n$$ K = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \u0026amp; \\beta \\\\ \\gamma \u0026amp; \\sigma \\end{bmatrix} $$ and satisfy the constraints $$ \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} + \\gamma \\bar{\\gamma} = 1 \\\\ \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} + \\beta \\bar{\\beta} = 1 \\\\ \\alpha \\bar{\\beta} + \\gamma \\bar{\\sigma} = 0 \\\\ \\alpha \\sigma + \\beta \\gamma = 1 \\\\ \\beta = -\\bar{\\gamma} \\\\ \\sigma = \\bar{\\alpha} $$ where $ \\alpha $, $ \\beta $, $ \\gamma $, and $ \\sigma $ are the Cayley-Klein parameters and $ \\bar{\\alpha} $, $ \\bar{\\beta} $, $ \\bar{\\gamma} $, and $ \\bar{\\sigma} $ are the conjugate of the Cayley-Klein parameters.

These hypercomplex numbers are optimum for numerical stability and memory load. The Euler parameters are a four-dimensional vector that can be used to represent the orientation of a rigid body. The Euler parameters are defined as:\n$$ q = \\begin{bmatrix} q_0 \\\\ q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\\\ q_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$ where $q_0$ is the scalar part and $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are the vector part.

Quaternions do not have any singularity such as Euler angles. However, due to the lack of independence of components, it may present difficulties in the application of the filter equations. The quaternion is not unique, and the mirror quaternion will result in the same rotation. This is a purely mathematical representation and based upon single rotation theta around vector e with angle.

For example, the Euler angles $ (0,0,0) $ and $ (2\\pi,2\\pi,2\\pi) $ represent the same rotation. The Euler angles are also not invariant to the order of the rotations. For example, the Euler angles $ R_{x,y,z}(0,0,0) $ and $ R_{z,y,x}(0,0,0) $ represent the same rotation, but the rotation matrix is different. Three rotation angles $\\phi$, $\\theta$, and $\\psi$ are about the sequential displaced body-fixed axes, and twelve different sequences are possible that can be used for the same rotation. The location of each sequential rotation depends on the preceding rotation, and there are divided into two main categories:\nSymmetric sequences: The first and third rotations are performed around the same axis, second rotation is performed around one of the two others: $$ R_{i,j,i}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = R_i(\\alpha)R_j(\\beta)R_i(\\gamma) $$ Symmetric sequence $ (i,j,i)$, $ i \\ne j$, $ \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}$ Asymmetric sequences: All rotations performed around three different axes: $$ R_{i,j,k}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = R_i(\\alpha)R_j(\\beta)R_k(\\gamma) $$ Asymmetric sequence $ (i,j,k)$, $ i \\ne j \\ne k \\ne i$, $ \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}$ These angles are not unique, and the mirror angles will result in the same rotations.\nFor Symmetric sequences: $ R(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = R(\\alpha + \\pi, -\\beta,\\gamma - \\pi) $ For Asymmetric sequences: $ R(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = R(\\alpha + \\pi, \\pi -\\beta,\\gamma - \\pi) $ The main disadvantages of Euler angles are:\nSingularity Non-uniqueness Non-invariance Less accuracy for integration of attitude incremental changes over time At $ \\theta = \\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $ the singularities will occur and usually known as mathematical gimble lock where to axes are parallel to each other.\nQuaternion\nReferences: [1] Markley, F.

There are an infinite number of attitude representations, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the proper attitude representation depends on the estimation algorithm, type of the moving object (e.g. satellite, spacecraft), type of mission, and reference frame selection. Attitude representation impacts mathematical complexity, geometrical singularities, and operational range, so it’s crucial to choose the proper representation for the objectives. At least, three coordinates are needed to describe the attitude in a 3D space that has at least one singularity. Singularities can be avoided by using four or more coordinates, but even the use of four coordinates does not guarantee their avoidance.\nThere are various attitude representations that are common in the industry, such as Direction Cosine Matrix, Euler angles, Euler Parameters (Quaternions), Gibb’s vectors, and so on. We will describe a few of them below.\nTo maintain consistency in mathematical notations, two reference frames (as a reference frame) and (as a body frame) have been defined as follows:\n$$ N \\equiv \\begin{bmatrix} n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ n_3 \\end{bmatrix}, B \\equiv \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$ Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) In mathematics, a direction cosine matrix (DCM) is a matrix that transforms coordinate reference frames. Attitude Matrix, also known as DCM, is the most fundamental and redundant method of describing relative attitudes.\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\begin{bmatrix} r_{11} \u0026amp; r_{12} \u0026amp; r_{13} \\\\ r_{21} \u0026amp; r_{22} \u0026amp; r_{23} \\\\ r_{31} \u0026amp; r_{32} \u0026amp; r_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3} $$ There are nine parameters, of which six are redundant due to orthogonality. The DCM elements can be described as the dot product of coordinate system axes, which express the base vector as follows:\n$$ DCM = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\cdot n_1 \u0026amp; b_1 \\cdot n_2 \u0026amp; b_1 \\cdot n_3 \\\\ b_2 \\cdot n_1 \u0026amp; b_2 \\cdot n_2 \u0026amp; b_2 \\cdot n_3 \\\\ b_3 \\cdot n_1 \u0026amp; b_3 \\cdot n_2 \u0026amp; b_3 \\cdot n_3\\end{bmatrix} $$ In the other hand, the cosine of three angles between each body vector $ b_i, (i=1,2,3) $ and three axes $ n_i, (i=1,2,3) $ are called the direction cosine matrix. $$ b_i = cos(\\alpha_{i1}\\mathbf{n}_1) + cos(\\alpha_{i2}\\mathbf{n}_2) + cos(\\alpha_{i3}\\mathbf{n}_3) \\\\ i=1,2,3 $$ So, the direction cosine matrix can be rewritten by:\n$$ DCM = \\begin{bmatrix} cos(\\alpha_{11}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{12}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{13}) \\\\ cos(\\alpha_{21}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{22}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{23}) \\\\ cos(\\alpha_{31}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{32}) \u0026amp; cos(\\alpha_{33}) \\end{bmatrix} $$ So,\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\text{DCM} \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} $$ where $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ are the unit vectors of the body and reference frames, respectively.\nAxis-Angle Representation Euler’s theorem states that all rotations of a solid object can be expressed as single rotation $ \\theta $ about a unit length axis $ e $ in the rotation plane. In other words, each orthogonal matrix $ R $ has a specified unit vector rotation axis donated $ e $, known as Euler axis, and a single rotation angle $ \\theta $ is called Euler angle. The axis angle representation can be written as:\n$$ \\theta \\mathbf{e}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta e_1 \\ \\theta e_2 \\ \\theta e_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nwhere\n$$ \\mathbf{e} = \\begin{bmatrix} e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nand\n$$ |\\mathbf{e}| = 1 $$\nSince, $(e,\\theta)$ and $(-e,-\\theta)$ correspond to the same rotation, it’s not a unique representation. The axis-angle representation is not a good choice for attitude estimation because it has a singularity at $\\theta = \\pi$. The axis-angle representation is also not a good choice for attitude control because it is not a linear representation. The axis-angle representation is a good choice for attitude visualization. The axis-angle representation is also a good choice for attitude initialization.\nEuler Angles\nReferences: [1] Markley, F. Landis, and John L. Crassidis.

Most aerial or space vehicles have subsystem(s) that must be pointed to a specific direction, known as pointing modes, e.g., Sun pointing, Earth pointing. For example, communications satellites, keeping satellites antenna pointed to the Earth continuously, is the key to the successful mission. That will be achieved only if we have proper knowledge of the vehicle’s orientation; in other words, the attitude must be determined. In this post, the fundamental concepts for defining the attitude of an object in the three-dimensional space will be presented. It is necessary to have a clear view of the exact meaning of the attitude or orientation. So, at first, the attitude and attitude terminology will be defined. Then the mathematical relationships between the attitude and the angular velocity will be presented. Finally, the attitude and angular velocity will be used to define the attitude dynamics.\nAttitude and Attitude Terminology Attitude is the mathematical representation of the orientation in space related to the reference frames. Attitude parameters (attitude coordinates) refer to sets of parameters (coordinates) that fully describe a rigid body’s attitude, which is not unique expressions. At least three parameters are required to describe the orientation uniquely. The process of determining these parameters is called attitude determination. Attitude determination methods can be divided in two categories: static and dynamic.\nStatic Attitude Determination is a point-to-point time-independent attitude-determining method with the memoryless approach, also known as attitude determination. It is the observations or measurements processing to obtain the information for describing the object’s orientation relative to a reference frame. It could be determined by measuring the directions from the vehicle to the known points, i.e., Attitude Knowledge. Due to accuracy limit, measurement noise, model error, and process error, most deterministic approaches are inefficient for accurate prospects; in this situation, using statistical methods will be a good solution.\nDynamic Attitude Determination methods, also known as Attitude estimation, refer to using mathematical methods and techniques (e.g., statistical and probabilistic) to predict and estimate the future attitude based on a dynamic model and prior measurements. These techniques fuse data that retain a series of measurements using algorithms such as filtering, Multi-Sensor-Data-Fusion.\nSuppose we consider attitude estimation as mathematical methods and attitude determination as instruments and measurements. In that case, we could find that no such works had been done in attitude estimation until the eighteenth or nineteenth century, as M.D. Shuster mentioned in [ 1, 2] attitude estimation is a young and underdeveloped field such that Sputnik 1 (the first artificial satellite) and Echo 1 (the first passive communications satellite experiment) did not have attitude determination and control system (ADCS). Also, the next generation of spacecraft has an attitude control system without any attitude estimation. Those spacecraft used passive attitude control methods such as gravity gradient attitude stabilization.\nAt first, two frames must be defined to formulate the attitude, the body frame $B$ and the Observer frame $O$. Then we can define the attitude as the orientation of the $B$ frame with respect to the $O$ frame. Usually, the rigid body orientation is given with respect to an inertial frame called Inertial Fixed References System (IFRS). As mentioned before, attitude is a set of coordinates which defines the orientation. It could be a 3D vector which is represented by a 3D rotation matrix. The basic rotation matrix (also called elemental rotation) is a 3x3 matrix which is used to rotate the coordinate system by an angle $\\theta$ about $x$, $y$, or $z$ axis and defined by the following equation:\n$$ R_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix} $$ $$ R_y = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix} $$ $$ R_z = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ where $\\theta$ is the angle of rotation.\nAttitude Representation\nReferences [ 1 ] M.
