## Machine Learning Engineer | AI Researcher | Deep Learning Specialist

Hello! I'm Arman, a Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in Large Language Models, transformer architectures, computer vision systems, and autonomous robotics. I focus on building production-ready AI solutions that bridge research and industry applications.

## Professional Focus

My expertise spans across **enterprise AI solutions**, where I've implemented production-ready RAG systems reducing operational costs by 35% through PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning and quantization techniques. I've built retrieval systems with 92% accuracy using vector embeddings and hybrid retrieval approaches, developed multimodal pipelines integrating vision models with transformers, and deployed end-to-end ML infrastructure across major cloud platforms.

## Research & Development

My research interests center on **robot learning and autonomous navigation**, focusing on Visual-Inertial SLAM, multi-modal perception, and real-time state estimation. I develop end-to-end learning systems for real-time navigation in dynamic and uncertain settings, and explore the integration of large language models for interpretable navigation and mission planning. Recent work includes transformer-enhanced physics-informed neural networks (TE-PINN) achieving 36.8% error reduction in attitude estimation.

## Core Competencies

**LLMs & NLP:** PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning, 4-bit/8-bit quantization (GGUF, AWQ), RAG systems, prompt engineering
**Computer Vision:** Object detection, segmentation, vision-language modeling (YOLO, Mask R-CNN, Vision Transformers)
**Autonomous Systems:** ROS2, ORB-SLAM3, LiDAR-SLAM, visual-inertial odometry, multi-sensor fusion
**Data Infrastructure:** Vector databases (FAISS, Qdrant, Vespa), BM25/TF-IDF indexing, hybrid retrieval systems
**ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Docker, FastAPI, TorchServe, DeepSpeed
