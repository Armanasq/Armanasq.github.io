abstract: This systematic review examines the current state and future prospects of in-space manufacturing technologies. As humanity expands its presence beyond Earth, the ability to manufacture components and structures in space becomes increasingly critical for sustainable space exploration and settlement. This paper comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in additive manufacturing, materials processing, and robotic assembly systems designed for the space environment. We evaluate the technical challenges posed by microgravity, vacuum conditions, and radiation exposure, while identifying promising solutions and ongoing research initiatives. The review covers orbital manufacturing facilities, lunar in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and asteroid mining technologies. We discuss the economic implications, potential applications for deep space missions, and the role of in-space manufacturing in establishing permanent human presence beyond Earth. Key findings highlight the transformative potential of space-based manufacturing for reducing launch costs, enabling large-scale space infrastructure, and supporting long-duration missions to Mars and beyond.
