abstract: This study introduces MORAD ESCAPE, an innovative research-based escape room methodology designed to assess research competencies among health professions students. Traditional assessment methods for research skills often fail to capture the practical, applied nature of research conduct in real-world scenarios. MORAD ESCAPE addresses this gap by creating an immersive, gamified environment where students must apply research knowledge and skills to solve challenges and progress through the escape room. The approach evaluates multiple dimensions of research competency including literature review, study design, data analysis, ethical considerations, and scientific communication. Through puzzle-solving and collaborative tasks, students demonstrate their ability to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical research application. Pilot testing with health professions students showed high engagement levels and provided valuable insights into students' research competency profiles. The escape room format offers a novel, engaging alternative to traditional written examinations while providing educators with rich, behavioral data on students' research capabilities. MORAD ESCAPE represents a scalable approach to research competency assessment applicable across various health professions education contexts.
